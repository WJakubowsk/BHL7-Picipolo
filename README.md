## Problem

New York City as a centre of one of the most populated aglomerations worldwide poses a great case study of large metropolies functionins. Data about real estate prices and details in NYC in 2021 can let us deepen our understanding of the process of forming property prices in huge, overcrowded cities. Analyze the dataset you are provided with and find the use in real world of the knowledge you gained during this process.

## Solution and implementation:

Web Application displaying prices of real estates in near location and predicting whether they are over-priced, realiable or under-priced.

- Optimized Machine Learning model called Random Forest Regressor which predicted the price of property based on severl features like longitude, latitude, metrage using Sci-kit Learn Python library
- Constructed Web Scrapper in Python using Beautiful Soup and Request packages in order to retrieve more data about housing market prices in NYC Technopolis from housing market sites (Zillow.com, Trulia.com)
